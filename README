Abstract:

Pong is one of the first video games ever made. Atari were the original
creators of the game and it is meant to be a two dimensional version of the
game table tennis. The game consists of two vertically oriented bars that 
are on the edges of the screen and there is a dot that is viewed as the 
ball. The ball is set in a random direction and the player who last won the
point will have the chance to hit the ball first indicating their serve. 
Points are gained by getting the ball past the opponentâ€™s vertical bar and
the game is played to a number of points. The implementation of this game 
will require direct application of the material learned thus far in EE354 
and will be a sufficient challenge to show mastery of the material. This 
will also be a fun project to demonstrate as it will pay homage to one of
the most important games in video game history.

Description:

The game will be implemented on the Xilinx Spartan6 FPGA and will output
the game using the VGA port on the Nexys 3 board to a video monitor. The
buttons on the board will be used as inputs for up and down for the
vertical bars which resemble each player. Two counters will be needed to  
keep track of the Scores of each player and the switches/push buttons could
be used to organize the initial setup of the game as in who is player one 
or two, difficulty setting coordinating to how fast the ball will move
across the screen, or how long each players bar could be. These are all
settings to how hard/easy the game wants to be played by the players. All 
game design software will be implemented
